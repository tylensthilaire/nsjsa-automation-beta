# NSJSA Automation Prototype

This is the source code for the NSJSA Automation prototype
and its documentation site.
It is built using the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs)
and end extended with components frome the [DWP Design System](https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk/index).
This prototype is used to share ideas and to do user research.

## Quickstart Guide

To run the site locally,
clone the repo,
install the npm dependencies
and run the serve command.
Once cloned,
the repository should be self documenting
– if not,
contact a [contributor](/graphs/contributors) for help.

## Conventions

<details>
  <summary><strong><a href='https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/'>Trunk based development</a></strong> separates the work in progress from work completed.</summary>

- `main` is the latest used to preview or QA work in progress.
- `production` a stable, _live_ environment for researching with.
<!--
- If future iterations of a prototype are needed concurrently,
  create 'release' branches for each.
- To revisit an older iteration,
  fork the release branch and pull changes into `main` through it.
  -->
  
  </details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Date-based versioning</strong> allows us to look at the prototype as it was at a specific point in time.</summary>

- Add tags to commits used for research, show and tells, et al in the format `YYMMDD-Event-Type`.
- Create releases from these tags for archiving as needed.
- ‘Fix forward‘ to keep the commit history traceable

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong><a href='https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/'>Conventional Commits</a></strong> keep the project history easy to understand.</summary>

- Each commit should add a whole feature or fix a whole bug.
- Commits should never 'break the build' so that we can test or share at any time.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Linting</strong> enforces code formatting and conventions consistent.</summary>

- The GOV.UK Prototype Kit uses [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/) for javascript files.
- Other files use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Recommended Visual Studio Code settings and extensions are included in the repository.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Continuous deployment</strong> processes automatically deploy the latest code pushed to Github for each branch with <a href='https://render.com/'>Render</a>.</summary>

- When you add a branch (e.g. a release branch) you will need to configure a new app in Render
- `main` is deployed to [nsjsa-automation-staging.onrender.com](https://nsjsa-automation-staging.onrender.com)
- `production` is deployed to [nsjsa-automation-cbkl.onrender.com](https://nsjsa-automation-cbkl.onrender.com)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Self documenting</strong> code, in the form of comments, ensures the repo is easy for people to pick up and run with.</summary>

- Keep in mind that the GOV.UK Prototyping Kit is designed to require “minimal skills to get started”.
- Use extra README files per directory as required.
